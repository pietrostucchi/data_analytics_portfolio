# Statistics and Probability

## Summary

Here, I'm showing some simple Python code in Jupyter Notebooks about statistics and probability.

I've used these libraries to retrieve, clean, manipulate and plot data:
* pandas
* numpy
* scipy
* datetime
* time
* os
* requests
* BeautifulSoup
* matplotlib
* seaborn

Data are from different sources. For the first Notebook, ```call_center.ipynb```, I've downloaded data from this [link on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/satvicoder/call-center-data?resource=download). You can also see them in ```Call Center Data``` folder.
In the second Notebook, ```planets_iris.ipynb```, data are from seaborn library.
Then, the last Notebook is about probability. In ```coin_dice_ball.ipynb```, I've written some short programs and functions about probability of coin tosses and rolls of dice. Thus, I haven't loaded data, but I've just scraped some strings from Wikipedia to write a program that simulates a negatively biased Magic 8 Ball. So, read the code until the end and try asking the Ball something!
